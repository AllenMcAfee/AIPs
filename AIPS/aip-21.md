Abstract
========
This AIP proposes the creation of ARK Masternodes


Motivation
==========

With the current version of the ARK protocol the only nodes that are incentivized are Forging nodes. As such, there is no significant support outside of delegates to maintain a strong relay network to further decentralize and create and more resilient ARK network. This AIP proposes the following:
- Establishment of a new incentivized relay type (e.g., Ark Masternode)
- Change to block rewards to support ARK Masternodes
- Mechanism to check ARK Masternodes for performance
- Mechanism to reward ARK Masternodes

Specifications
==============

### 1. Block Rewards Adjustment:

### 2. Updated Core Commander:

### 3. Masternode Performance Monitor:

### 4. Masternode rewards distribution:
