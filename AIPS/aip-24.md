## Abstract
The purpose of this AIP is to include rules and apply penalty for delegates that performed double forging. A protocol change is proposed to notify all nodes when double forged blocks are detected, thus reaching consensus on bad forger.

## Motivation
Handle double forging when it occurs, notify all peers and introduce a network wide system ban. Banning a rogue delegate would enable the network to move forward, without the need to handle fork logic and additional rebuilds, or ending up in splitting the chain up to N chains.

## Rationale
Proposed solution will detect the double forged block and notify all (also blocked) peers about the possible double forgery. Related nodes/peers will act upon received information and decide accordingly to their own logic.

## Specifications
### API: Introduce a new p2p endpoint to inform about possible double forging
A new public API endpoint will be introduced - `POST /blocks/doubleforgery`. This endpoint will receive the double forged detected block. The endpoint call will:
1. Detect and validate double forged block
2. Confirm or Deny double forgery
3. Ban block generator for next 1500 blocks from the height detected by double forging (if confirmed doubleforgery)
4. Handle revert block logic accordingly - remove double forged block

// TODO 
- throttle? 
- do we remove double forged blocks

### CHORE: Block validation
1. We detect the double forged block
2. Detected block is transmitted to all known peers (also blocked and banned) peers by calling the endpoint introduced above
3. Handle revert block logic accordingly

### CHORE: Revert logic of double forged blocks
1. Double forgery is confirmed
2. We remove the double forged block from the chains
3. We update delegate rewards accordingly (reduce/depends on the rebuild logic)
4. Transaction is the double forged block are to be added back to the transaction pool-if they pass the guard process
